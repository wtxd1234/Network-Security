# Introduction to Cryptography
## Cryptography is Everywhere
- Secure Communications
- Encrypting files on the computer
- data Protection (DVD, Blu-ray...)
- Authentication, Digital Signature, Secret Sharing, E-Voting, E-Coin...

## Cryptography Goals
1. Confidentiality
2. Integrity
3. Non-repudiation
4. Authentication

## Cryptography Terminology
- __Plaintext__- original message
- __Ciphertext__- coded message
- __Cipher__- algorithm for transforming plaintext to ciphertext
- __Key__- info used in cipher known only to sender/receiver (must be private=unknown)
- __Encipher (encrypt)__- converting plaintext to ciphertext
- __Decipher (decrypt)__- recovering ciphertext from plaintext
- __Cryptography__- Study of encryption principles/methods
- __Cryptoanalysis (code breaking)__– Study of principles/methods of deciphering cipher text without knowing key
- __Cryptology__– Field of both cryptography and cryptoanalysis
