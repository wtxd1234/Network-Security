# Introduction
## Cybersecurity

- Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks.
- Cybersecurity measures are designed to combat threats against networked systems and applications.

## Cybersecurity Subsets

- ___Information security___:
  - refers to the preservation of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of __information__.
  - Additionally, authenticity, accountability, nonrepudiation, and reliability can also be involved.

- ___Network security___ :
  - Protecting the __networks and their services__ from unwanted users, attacks, and intrusions.
 
## Security Key Principle/Objectives:

## Security Principle: CIA Triad

- __Confidentiality__: Preserving __unauthorized access__ to the data.
  - Data Confidentiality
  - Privacy

- __Integrity__: Assures that data are __changed__ only in a specified and authorized manner.
  - Data Integrity
  - System Integrity
 
- __Availability__: Authorized users should be __able to access data all the time__. The systems and services are not denied to authorized users.

## Additional Security Principle

- __Authenticity真实性__: Being __genuine真实__ and being able to be verified and trusted.

- __Accountability可追踪性__: __Tracing__ the entity (have particular responsibilities).

## CIA Triad ATM Example

- It provides __confidentiality__ by requiring two-factor __authentication__
(both a physical card and a PIN code) before allowing access to
data.
- The ATM and bank software enforces data __integrity__ by ensuring
that any transfers or withdrawals made via the machine are
reflected in the accounting for the user's bank account.
- The machine provides __availability__ because it's in a public place
and is accessible even when the bank branch is closed.

## Other Security Terms

- ___Threats___: A __potential潜在__ for violation of security.
- ___Attack___: An __assault突击__ on system security that derives from an
intelligent threat.
- ___Vulnerability___: __Weakness__ in the security system that might be
exploited.
- ___Control___: An action, device, procedure, or technique that
__removes or reduces a vulnerability__.

___So, threats are blocked by controlling the vulnerabilities.___
