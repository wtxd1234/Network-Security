## Active and passive attacks 
- Active attacks are those that __alter__ or disrupt the system resources or affect the normal functioning of the system. Passive attacks are those that __only observe or analyze__ the system data or traffic without affecting it.

## Active vs Passive attack
- Active attacks are __easier to detect but harder to prevent__, while passive attacks are __harder to detect but easier to prevent__.
- Active attacks can cause __damage or denial of service__, while passive attacks can cause __loss of confidentiality or privacy__.

## Name and define the (key) security principles 
The key security principles are __confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity, accountability, nonrepudiation__, and __reliability__.
1. __Confidentiality__ means __preserving unauthorized access__ to the data.
2. __Integrity__ means assuring that data are __changed only in a specified and authorized manner__.
3. __Availability__ means ensuring that authorized users can __access data and resources all the time__.
4. __Authenticity__ means __verifying the identity__ and genuineness of an entity.
5. __Accountability__ means __tracing the actions__ and responsibilities of an entity.
6. __Nonrepudiation__ means __preventing an entity from denying a previous action__ or commitment.
7. __Reliability__ means ensuring the consistent and __correct functioning of the system__.

## Name and define the main security services
The main security services base on the __ITU-T X.800__ standard are __authentication, access control, data confidentiality, data integrity, nonrepudiation__, and __availability__.
1. __Authentication__ means __proving the identity of an entity__ by means of information exchange.
2. __Access control__ means enforcing the rights and __permissions__ of an entity __to use a resource__.
3. __Data confidentiality__ means __protecting data from unauthorized disclosure__.
4. __Data integrity__ means ensuring that data received is as __sent by an authorized entity__.
5. __Nonrepudiation__ means __providing evidence__ of the origin and delivery of data.
6. __Availability__ means ensuring that resources are __accessible and usable by authorized entities__.

## Name and define the main security mechanisms 
The main security mechanisms are __cryptographic algorithms, data integrity algorithms, digital signatures, authentication exchanges, traffic padding, routing control, notarization__, and __access control__. 
1. __Cryptographic algorithms__ are __mathematical functions__ that __transform data into unintelligible forms using keys__.
2. __Data integrity algorithms__ are methods that __generate and verify checksums__ or hashes of data to __detect any alteration__.
3. __Digital signatures__ are data appended to or transformed from a data unit that __prove the source and integrity__ of the data unit.
4. __Authentication exchanges__ are protocols that __enable the parties to verify each other's identity and credentials__.
5. __Traffic padding__ is the __insertion of bits into gaps in a data stream__ to __frustrate traffic analysis__.
6. __Routing control__ is the __selection of secure routes__ for data transmission and the __ability to change routes__ when needed.
7. __Notarization__ is the use of a __trusted third party__ to __attest certain properties of a data exchange__.
8. __Access control__ is the __implementation of policies and rules__ that regulate the access to resources.

## DOS and DDOS
- __DOS__ stands for __denial of service__, which is an attack that __prevents or impairs the authorized use of a system or resource__.<br>![image](https://github.com/wtxd1234/Network-Security/assets/41671135/bb014707-6880-404e-a84a-59608c8a1283)

- __DDOS__ stands for __distributed denial of service__, which is an attack that __employs multiple compromised devices to launch a coordinated DOS attack against a target__.

## Different types of attacks 
There are many types of attacks, but some common ones are __replay, modification, masquerade, man-in-the-middle, phishing, spoofing, malware__, and __social engineering__. 
1. __Replay__ is an attack that involves __retransmitting a previously captured message to produce an unauthorized effect__.<br>![image](https://github.com/wtxd1234/Network-Security/assets/41671135/97a66cfc-0a6c-49c5-a844-3e2040cf8e13)

2. __Modification__ is an attack that involves __altering the content or format of a message__ to deceive the receiver or cause damage.<br>![image](https://github.com/wtxd1234/Network-Security/assets/41671135/cdf45578-9cbf-411c-a5ac-e1d6a52981bb)

3. __Masquerade__ is an attack that involves __impersonating another entity to gain unauthorized access__ or privileges.<br>![image](https://github.com/wtxd1234/Network-Security/assets/41671135/f34a313d-484c-4111-8011-f6db9d5b7fce)

4. __Man-in-the-middle__ is an attack that involves intercepting and __modifying the communication between two parties without their knowledge__.
5. __Phishing__ is an attack that involves __sending fraudulent emails or messages__ that appear to come from legitimate sources to __trick the recipients into revealing sensitive information__ or clicking malicious links.
6. __Spoofing__ is an attack that __involves falsifying the source__ or identity of a message or packet to __mislead the receiver or bypass security measures__.
7. __Malware__ is an attack that involves __installing malicious software on a device or system__ to compromise its functionality or security.
8. __Social engineering__ is an attack that involves __manipulating or deceiving people into performing actions__ or divulging information that benefit the attacker.
