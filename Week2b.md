## Cryptography Systems
- Type of __encryption operations__ used:
   1. __Substitution__ (mapping to another character)
   2. __Transposition__ (rearranging the character)
- __Number of keys__ used:
   1. ___Single-key___: aka __Symmetric__, secret-key, private, or conventional cryptography 
(same key)
   2. ___Two-key___: aka __Asymmetric__, two-key, or public cryptography (different keys)
- Way in which __plaintext is processed__:
   1. __Block__ (only one block at a time)
   2. __Stream__ (process elements continuously)

## Classical Substitution Cipher
- A __substitution cipher__ replaces one symbol with another.
  - __Monoalphabetic__ replaces the same symbol with the same another symbol.
  - __Polyalphabetic__ replaces the same symbol with different symbols at each occurrence.

## Caesar Cipher
- It is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption.
- Used by Julius Caesar.
- It's a type of __substitution cipher__.
- Each letter of a given text is __replaced__ by a letter standing __three__ places further down the alphabet.
