- A model for the operation of public-key (asymmetric) cryptography consists of the following parts:¹[1]
    - **Key generation**: Each user generates a pair of keys, one public and one private, using a mathematical algorithm²[2]. The public key is shared with anyone, while the private key is kept secret³[3].
    - **Encryption**: The sender encrypts a message with the recipient's public key, using an encryption algorithm⁴[4]. The encrypted message can only be decrypted by the corresponding private key.
    - **Decryption**: The recipient decrypts the message with their own private key, using a decryption algorithm. The decrypted message is the original message sent by the sender.
- Asymmetric cryptography for authentication can be illustrated as follows:⁵[5]
    - **Digital signature**: The sender signs a message with their own private key, using a signature algorithm⁶[6]. The signature is appended to the message and sent to the recipient.
    - **Signature verification**: The recipient verifies the signature with the sender's public key, using a verification algorithm. The verification confirms the authenticity and integrity of the message and the sender.
- The vulnerabilities of Diffie-Hellman algorithm are:⁷[7]
    - **Man-in-the-middle attack**: An attacker can intercept the public values exchanged by the two parties and replace them with their own, thus establishing separate keys with each party and eavesdropping or altering the communication.
    - **Small subgroup attack**: An attacker can send a specially crafted public value that belongs to a small subgroup of the group used by the Diffie-Hellman algorithm, thus reducing the entropy and security of the shared key.
    - **Logjam attack**: An attacker can exploit the use of weak or common parameters (such as prime numbers or generators) by the Diffie-Hellman algorithm, thus breaking the discrete logarithm problem and recovering the shared key.
- The advantages and disadvantages of RSA are:⁸[8]
    - **Advantages**:
        - RSA is widely used and standardized for various applications, such as encryption, digital signatures, and key exchange.
        - RSA is based on the hardness of factoring large numbers, which is believed to be a computationally intractable problem.
        - RSA can provide both confidentiality and authentication, depending on how the keys are used.
    - **Disadvantages**:
        - RSA is computationally expensive and slow, especially for large key sizes and long messages.
        - RSA is vulnerable to chosen ciphertext attacks, where an attacker can decrypt a ciphertext by sending modified versions of it to a decryption oracle and observing the responses.
        - RSA requires careful implementation and parameter selection to avoid potential weaknesses and attacks.
- Some applications of RSA are:⁹[9]
    - **Secure communication protocols**: RSA can be used to establish secure channels and exchange session keys between parties, such as in SSL/TLS, SSH, and IPsec protocols[^10^][10].
    - **Public key encryption**: RSA can be used to encrypt messages or files with the recipient's public key, ensuring confidentiality and non-repudiation.
    - **Digital signatures**: RSA can be used to sign messages or files with the sender's private key, ensuring integrity and authenticity⁶[6].
- It is recommended to use a combination of symmetric and asymmetric algorithms in real-world scenarios because:
    - Symmetric algorithms are faster and more efficient for encrypting large amounts of data, but they require a secure way to share the secret key.
    - Asymmetric algorithms are slower and more complex for encrypting large amounts of data, but they provide a secure way to exchange the secret key or authenticate the parties¹¹[11].
    - By combining the two types of algorithms, one can achieve both security and efficiency in various applications, such as secure communication, encryption, or authentication¹²[12].
